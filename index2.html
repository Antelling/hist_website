<h1>The Atlantic Wall</h1>

<div class="left-card">
    The Atlantic Wall was an extensive collection of Nazi fortifications placed along the Atlantic coast of Europe.
    It stretched from the Spain-France border then up Norway.
</div>

<div class="center-card big">
    <p>The wall consisted of large, fixed artillery, mortars, and hundreds of bases for thousands of soldiers.</p>

<div class="right-card medium">
    <p>Over 600 different plans for different bunkers and artillery casings were used by more then 260,000 workers
        over a period of 2 years. The wall had a cost of more then 206 billion dollars in today's money. More then
        1.2 million tons of steel were used.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="center-card">
    More then 5 million mines were placed along the length of the wall. Additionally, troops stationed along the wall
    sighted large artillery on anticipated landing areas and practiced flooding the beach with machine gun fire.
</div>

<div class="left-card">
    Due to all of these defenses, Hitler believed the European coast to be safely under Axis control, and concentrated
    his troops on offensive positions, to try and capture more land for the Axis.

<div class="center-card medium">
    The Allies, however, believed that they could breach the wall. On the 6th of June, 1944, more then 155,000 Allied
    troops
    landed on the Normandy coast of France and began a western assault into Nazi controlled Europe.
    The Nazi troops were unprepared for this attack, as a campaign of misinformation produced by the Allies
    had convinced Hitler that any landings would happen further along the French Coast.

<h1>D-Day Assault</h1>

<div class="right-card big">
    The Normandy coast was divided into 5 sections: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. America, Britain, and Canada
    split up these targets and launched a coordinated attack.

</div>

<div class="left-card big">
    First, 24,000 paratroopers were dropped into the Normandy interior during the night. These troops were responsible
    for taking control of bridges, sabotaging communications, and doing whatever else they could to disrupt the movement
    of Nazi forces.
    <img src="http://www.ww2incolor.com/news/images/1066.jpg">
    Although the wind blew most paratroopers off target, they were each capable of doing all of the assigned jobs,
    and so were fairly successful. 
</div>

<div class="center-card big">
    Next, there was extensive naval and arial bombardment of the Nazi fortifications and coastal guns.

</div>

<div class="left-card">
    Then, allied troops landed an attack with amphibious tanks and boats. Many soldiers had to wade through the ocean
    to reach the beach, through heavy machine gun fire. The Allies landed 2 hours after low tide, to allow Allied ships
    a closer approach, but this increased the distance men had to run up the beach.

<div class="right-card">
    The coasts of Normandy had been heavily fortified by the Axis, and were covered in barbed wire, anti-tank tripods,
    and mines.

</div>

<div class="left-card">
    While soldiers were attempting to navigate the beach, Nazi machine guns and artillery were continually bombarding
    them. In some locations, like Omaha, Allied soldiers had to scale cliffs in order to take out these guns.

<div class="left-card medium">
    The Allies had very ambitious expectations of D-Day, hoping to control and connect all 5 beaches by the end
    of the first day. They were not as successful as the hoped, managing to connect only two of the beaches after
    the first day. However, in the following days all beaches were captured and the Allies secured a foothold for their
    invasion into Nazi controlled Europe.
</div>

<div class="right-card">
    D-Day had a very high amount of casualties - over 425,000 German and Allied troops were killed, injured, or
    went missing during the Battle of Normandy.
</div>

<div class="center-card medium">
    The Atlantic Wall is widely considered to be a failure, as Allied troops broke through the billion dollar defenses
    in only a few hours, and secured a beach to base further operations out of in only a few days. Many remnants of the
    wall remain littered across Europe.
